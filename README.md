# BuddyBot

The goal of this project is to create a Discord bot that can do all of the following:
1. Process speech as commands
2. Respond using a synthesized voice
3. Utilize only open-source, free libraries

This program will establish a framework that allows any developer to easily tweak this bot and add their own commands
with no need for a subscription to an expensive API.
